### Introduction
This implemenation guide is based on the [CDA-CH-EMED eMedication](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--cdachemed-) [ART-DECOR®](https://www.art-decor.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page) specification which has been [published by eHealth Suisse](http://ehealthsuisse.art-decor.org/).   
[CDA-CH-EMED](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--cdachemed-) defines the documents for the exchange of medication information in the context of the EPR (electronic patient record) in Switzerland. The documents are based on the IHE Pharmacy Technical Framework modelled and specialized in the Building Block Repository [CH-PHARM](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-project--ch-pharm-). Base for this modelling was the report from [IPAG eMedikation, 7.6.2017](https://www.e-health-suisse.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/Dokumente/2017/D/170607_Bericht_eMedikation_IPAG.pdf) and the work of IPAG/eHealth Suisse.

The CH EMED implementation guide describes the FHIR representation of the defined **documents for the exchange of medication information**. This implementation guide is dependent on [CH Core](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-core/index.html) and [CH EPR Term](http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-term/index.html), which describe the Swiss specific context, especially related to the Swiss electronic patient record.

The following documents have been defined:
- [Medication Treatment Plan document](medication-treatment-plan-document.html)
- [Medication Prescription document](medication-prescription-document.html)
- [Medication Dispense document](medication-dispense-document.html)
- [Pharmaceutical Advice document](pharmaceutical-advice-document.html)
- [Medication List document](medication-list-document.html)
- [Medication Card document](medication-card-document.html)
