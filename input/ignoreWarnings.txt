# Fixed with next release: https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues/252
UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {Piece} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit 'Stk' SHOULD contain the annotation (it does not)

# Swiss specific value
Der Displayname f\u00fcr http://loinc.org#57828-6 sollte einer von ''Prescription list'' anstelle von 'PRESCRIPTIONS' sein.
