25 issues were opened during the ballot time. Additionally, there were several tickets opened in the analogous CDA project on Art-Décor: 
* Issues CH-EMED 
* Issues CDA-CH-EMED 
 
## Main comments 
The issues were evaluated and labelled There was only one duplicate (#30), although several issues touched on similar topics. Only one issue was labelled with “wontfix” (#18). The mainly disputed topics are listed below and a short summary given: 
 
Medication Statement 
The issues on Medication Statement concern required cardinalities and the coding of the drug, but also of the ingredients. There was not an overarching topic, but the single issues are nevertheless very relevant and have to be solved. 
 
Tickets: 
#39 At least coded active drug ingredients 
#27 Package size 
#26 CH EMED MedicationStatement Identifier as uuid required 
#24 EDQM - Pharmaceutical Dose Form 
#23 CH EMED Medication Profile - amount / ingredien.strength with uni 
#21 medication.code: cardinality should be 0 ...1  
#16 required nonstructured Dosage to strict?  
 
Structured Dosage including UnitsOfPresentation Value Set 
Strongly connected to the issues of Medication Statement are issues on the structured dosage, mostly on the untis coding. The according value set UnitsOfPresentation, which was introduced after the EPR Projectathon 2020, with the support of HCI solutions, led to several discussions also during the eMedication Projectathon.  
Another Value Set which got higher attention was the EventTiming: How to code the point in time when a drug should be taken? 
 
Tickets: 
#37 CH EMED Quantity with units: 1..1 
#35 define EventTiming for 1-1-1-1 dosing 
#22 2-7 Medication Card document - XML Representation1 
#38 UnitsOfPresentation 
#32 UnitsOfPresentation
