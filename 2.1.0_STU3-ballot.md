## General information

the exchange format.
During the Ballot 38 issues were reported for CH EMED. Four issues were reported for CDA-CH-EMED
and one issues are reported for CH-PHARM on ART-Decor:
* [Issues CH EMED](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues)
* [Issues CDA-CH-EMED](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-issues--cdachemed-)
* [Issues CH-PHARM](https://art-decor.org/art-decor/decor-issues--ch-pharm-)

## Comment topic Medication
The issues concern that ATC codes are used for the eMedication, the GTIN should be used for the indication of package sizes. Furthermore, the mapping is to be adapted so that the comment on dosage changes is made via PatientInstructions in dosage.patientInstruction. In addition, the possibility should be created that reserve medications can be documented.

### Issues
* [#156](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues/156) Feedback about MedicationDispense
* [#149](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues/149) Add ATC coding in Medication

* [#72](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues/72) InRes missing

## Comment topic Dosage
The issues concern that for the unstructured dosages a start and end date should be allowed, for the structured dosage the minimum cardinality should be adapted, further for the normal dosage asNeeded[x] should be allowed for the reserve medication. Two scenarios are to be adapted so that timing can be sent in a structured manner.

### Issues
* [#130](https://github.com/hl7ch/ch-emed/issues/130) Structured Dosage discussion

## Comment topic Author
The issues concern various questions about the author, such as the difference between document author and interpreter. Furthermore, one example should be adapted to use PractitionerRole instead of Practitioner and Organization and follow the pattern for ch-ext-time. To be able to represent the author in the Medication List, adjustments in the referenced resources are necessary.

## Comment topic Medication document
The issues concern a clear differentiation between MCD and MLD, proposals for other LOINC code use of Medication Card and Medication List. Furthermore, the description of MLD, MPD, MTD should be clarified. Furthermore, adjustments should be made to the validations and substitution should be allowed on the MCD.

## Comment topic Specification
The issues concern general adjustments to the specification such as section-id which come from CDA update from extension. Examples in the specification should respect the correct formatting.
